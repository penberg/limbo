    OpCodeDescription { name: "Abortable", description: "Verify that an Abort can happen. Assert if an Abort at this point might cause database corruption. This opcode only appears in debugging builds. An Abort is safe if either there have been no writes, or if there is an active statement journal." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Add", description: "Add the value in register P1 to the value in register P2 and store the result in register P3. If either input is NULL, the result is NULL." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AddImm", description: "Add the constant P2 to the value in register P1. The result is always an integer. To force any register to be an integer, just add 0." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Affinity", description: "Apply affinities to a range of P2 registers starting with P1. P4 is a string that is P2 characters long. The N-th character of the string indicates the column affinity that should be used for the N-th memory cell in the range." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AggFinal", description: "P1 is the memory location that is the accumulator for an aggregate or window function. Execute the finalizer function for an aggregate and store the result in P1. P2 is the number of arguments that the step function takes and P4 is a pointer to the FuncDef for this function. The P2 argument is not used by this opcode. It is only there to disambiguate functions that can take varying numbers of arguments. The P4 argument is only needed for the case where the step function was not previously called." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AggInverse", description: "Execute the xInverse function for an aggregate. The function has P5 arguments. P4 is a pointer to the FuncDef structure that specifies the function. Register P3 is the accumulator. The P5 arguments are taken from register P2 and its successors." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AggStep", description: "Execute the xStep function for an aggregate. The function has P5 arguments. P4 is a pointer to the FuncDef structure that specifies the function. Register P3 is the accumulator. The P5 arguments are taken from register P2 and its successors." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AggStep1", description: "Execute the xStep (if P1==0) or xInverse (if P1!=0) function for an aggregate. The function has P5 arguments. P4 is a pointer to the FuncDef structure that specifies the function. Register P3 is the accumulator. The P5 arguments are taken from register P2 and its successors. This opcode is initially coded as OP_AggStep0. On first evaluation, the FuncDef stored in P4 is converted into an sqlite3_context and the opcode is changed. In this way, the initialization of the sqlite3_context only happens once, instead of on each call to the step function." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AggValue", description: "Invoke the xValue() function and store the result in register P3. P2 is the number of arguments that the step function takes and P4 is a pointer to the FuncDef for this function. The P2 argument is not used by this opcode. It is only there to disambiguate functions that can take varying numbers of arguments. The P4 argument is only needed for the case where the step function was not previously called." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "And", description: "Take the logical AND of the values in registers P1 and P2 and write the result into register P3. If either P1 or P2 is 0 (false) then the result is 0 even if the other input is NULL. A NULL and true or two NULLs give a NULL output." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "AutoCommit", description: "Set the database auto-commit flag to P1 (1 or 0). If P2 is true, roll back any currently active btree transactions. If there are any active VMs (apart from this one), then a ROLLBACK fails. A COMMIT fails if there are active writing VMs or active VMs that use shared cache. This instruction causes the VM to halt." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "BeginSubrtn", description: "Mark the beginning of a subroutine that can be entered in-line or that can be called using Gosub. The subroutine should be terminated by an Return instruction that has a P1 operand that is the same as the P2 operand to this opcode and that has P3 set to 1. If the subroutine is entered in-line, then the Return will simply fall through. But if the subroutine is entered using Gosub, then the Return will jump back to the first instruction after the Gosub. This routine works by loading a NULL into the P2 register. When the return address register contains a NULL, the Return instruction is a no-op that simply falls through to the next instruction (assuming that the Return opcode has a P3 value of 1). Thus if the subroutine is entered in-line, then the Return will cause in-line execution to continue. But if the subroutine is entered via Gosub, then the Return will cause a return to the address following the Gosub. This opcode is identical to Null. It has a different name only to make the byte code easier to read and verify." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "BitAnd", description: "Take the bit-wise AND of the values in register P1 and P2 and store the result in register P3. If either input is NULL, the result is NULL." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "BitNot", description: "Interpret the content of register P1 as an integer. Store the ones-complement of the P1 value into register P2. If P1 holds a NULL then store a NULL in P2." },

    OpCodeDescription { name: "Blob", description: "P4 points to a blob of data P1 bytes long. Store this blob in register P2. If P4 is a NULL pointer, then construct a zero-filled blob that is P1 bytes long in P2." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Cast", description: "Force the value in register P1 to be the type defined by P2.
    P2=='A' → BLOB
    P2=='B' → TEXT
    P2=='C' → NUMERIC
    P2=='D' → INTEGER
    P2=='E' → REAL A NULL value is not changed by this routine. It remains NULL." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Checkpoint", description: "Checkpoint database P1. This is a no-op if P1 is not currently in WAL mode. Parameter P2 is one of SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_PASSIVE, FULL, RESTART, or TRUNCATE. Write 1 or 0 into mem[P3] if the checkpoint returns SQLITE_BUSY or not, respectively. Write the number of pages in the WAL after the checkpoint into mem[P3+1] and the number of pages in the WAL that have been checkpointed after the checkpoint completes into mem[P3+2]. However on an error, mem[P3+1] and mem[P3+2] are initialized to -1." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Clear", description: "Delete all contents of the database table or index whose root page in the database file is given by P1. But, unlike Destroy, do not remove the table or index from the database file. The table being cleared is in the main database file if P2==0. If P2==1 then the table to be cleared is in the auxiliary database file that is used to store tables create using CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE. If the P3 value is non-zero, then the row change count is incremented by the number of rows in the table being cleared. If P3 is greater than zero, then the value stored in register P3 is also incremented by the number of rows in the table being cleared. See also: Destroy" },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Close", description: "Close a cursor previously opened as P1. If P1 is not currently open, this instruction is a no-op." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "ClrSubtype", description: "Clear the subtype from register P1." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "CollSeq", description: "P4 is a pointer to a CollSeq object. If the next call to a user function or aggregate calls sqlite3GetFuncCollSeq(), this collation sequence will be returned. This is used by the built-in min(), max() and nullif() functions. If P1 is not zero, then it is a register that a subsequent min() or max() aggregate will set to 1 if the current row is not the minimum or maximum. The P1 register is initialized to 0 by this instruction. The interface used by the implementation of the aforementioned functions to retrieve the collation sequence set by this opcode is not available publicly. Only built-in functions have access to this feature." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Column", description: "Interpret the data that cursor P1 points to as a structure built using the MakeRecord instruction. (See the MakeRecord opcode for additional information about the format of the data.) Extract the P2-th column from this record. If there are less than (P2+1) values in the record, extract a NULL. The value extracted is stored in register P3. If the record contains fewer than P2 fields, then extract a NULL. Or, if the P4 argument is a P4_MEM use the value of the P4 argument as the result. If the OPFLAG_LENGTHARG bit is set in P5 then the result is guaranteed to only be used by the length() function or the equivalent. The content of large blobs is not loaded, thus saving CPU cycles. If the OPFLAG_TYPEOFARG bit is set then the result will only be used by the typeof() function or the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL operators or the equivalent. In this case, all content loading can be omitted." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "ColumnsUsed", description: "This opcode (which only exists if SQLite was compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_USED_MASK) identifies which columns of the table or index for cursor P1 are used. P4 is a 64-bit integer (P4_INT64) in which the first 63 bits are one for each of the first 63 columns of the table or index that are actually used by the cursor. The high-order bit is set if any column after the 64th is used." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Compare", description: "Compare two vectors of registers in reg(P1)..reg(P1+P3-1) (call this vector \"A\") and in reg(P2)..reg(P2+P3-1) (\"B\"). Save the result of the comparison for use by the next Jump instruct. If P5 has the OPFLAG_PERMUTE bit set, then the order of comparison is determined by the most recent Permutation operator. If the OPFLAG_PERMUTE bit is clear, then register are compared in sequential order. P4 is a KeyInfo structure that defines collating sequences and sort orders for the comparison. The permutation applies to registers only. The KeyInfo elements are used sequentially. The comparison is a sort comparison, so NULLs compare equal, NULLs are less than numbers, numbers are less than strings, and strings are less than blobs. This opcode must be immediately followed by an Jump opcode." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Concat", description: "Add the text in register P1 onto the end of the text in register P2 and store the result in register P3. If either the P1 or P2 text are NULL then store NULL in P3. P3 = P2 || P1 It is illegal for P1 and P3 to be the same register. Sometimes, if P3 is the same register as P2, the implementation is able to avoid a memcpy()." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Copy", description: "Make a copy of registers P1..P1+P3 into registers P2..P2+P3. If the 0x0002 bit of P5 is set then also clear the MEM_Subtype flag in the destination. The 0x0001 bit of P5 indicates that this Copy opcode cannot be merged. The 0x0001 bit is used by the query planner and does not come into play during query execution. This instruction makes a deep copy of the value. A duplicate is made of any string or blob constant. See also SCopy." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Count", description: "Store the number of entries (an integer value) in the table or index opened by cursor P1 in register P2. If P3==0, then an exact count is obtained, which involves visiting every btree page of the table. But if P3 is non-zero, an estimate is returned based on the current cursor position." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "CreateBtree", description: "Allocate a new b-tree in the main database file if P1==0 or in the TEMP database file if P1==1 or in an attached database if P1>1. The P3 argument must be 1 (BTREE_INTKEY) for a rowid table it must be 2 (BTREE_BLOBKEY) for an index or WITHOUT ROWID table. The root page number of the new b-tree is stored in register P2." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "CursorHint", description: "Provide a hint to cursor P1 that it only needs to return rows that satisfy the Expr in P4. TK_REGISTER terms in the P4 expression refer to values currently held in registers. TK_COLUMN terms in the P4 expression refer to columns in the b-tree to which cursor P1 is pointing." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "CursorLock", description: "Lock the btree to which cursor P1 is pointing so that the btree cannot be written by an other cursor." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "CursorUnlock", description: "Unlock the btree to which cursor P1 is pointing so that it can be written by other cursors." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "DecrJumpZero", description: "Register P1 must hold an integer. Decrement the value in P1 and jump to P2 if the new value is exactly zero." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "DeferredSeek", description: "P1 is an open index cursor and P3 is a cursor on the corresponding table. This opcode does a deferred seek of the P3 table cursor to the row that corresponds to the current row of P1. This is a deferred seek. Nothing actually happens until the cursor is used to read a record. That way, if no reads occur, no unnecessary I/O happens. P4 may be an array of integers (type P4_INTARRAY) containing one entry for each column in the P3 table. If array entry a(i) is non-zero, then reading column a(i)-1 from cursor P3 is equivalent to performing the deferred seek and then reading column i from P1. This information is stored in P3 and used to redirect reads against P3 over to P1, thus possibly avoiding the need to seek and read cursor P3." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Delete", description: "Delete the record at which the P1 cursor is currently pointing. If the OPFLAG_SAVEPOSITION bit of the P5 parameter is set, then the cursor will be left pointing at either the next or the previous record in the table. If it is left pointing at the next record, then the next Next instruction will be a no-op. As a result, in this case it is ok to delete a record from within a Next loop. If OPFLAG_SAVEPOSITION bit of P5 is clear, then the cursor will be left in an undefined state. If the OPFLAG_AUXDELETE bit is set on P5, that indicates that this delete is one of several associated with deleting a table row and all its associated index entries. Exactly one of those deletes is the \"primary\" delete. The others are all on OPFLAG_FORDELETE cursors or else are marked with the AUXDELETE flag. If the OPFLAG_NCHANGE (0x01) flag of P2 (NB: P2 not P5) is set, then the row change count is incremented (otherwise not). If the OPFLAG_ISNOOP (0x40) flag of P2 (not P5!) is set, then the pre-update-hook for deletes is run, but the btree is otherwise unchanged. This happens when the Delete is to be shortly followed by an Insert with the same key, causing the btree entry to be overwritten. P1 must not be pseudo-table. It has to be a real table with multiple rows. If P4 is not NULL then it points to a Table object. In this case either the update or pre-update hook, or both, may be invoked. The P1 cursor must have been positioned using NotFound prior to invoking this opcode in this case. Specifically, if one is configured, the pre-update hook is invoked if P4 is not NULL. The update-hook is invoked if one is configured, P4 is not NULL, and the OPFLAG_NCHANGE flag is set in P2. If the OPFLAG_ISUPDATE flag is set in P2, then P3 contains the address of the memory cell that contains the value that the rowid of the row will be set to by the update." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Destroy", description: "Delete an entire database table or index whose root page in the database file is given by P1. The table being destroyed is in the main database file if P3==0. If P3==1 then the table to be destroyed is in the auxiliary database file that is used to store tables create using CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE. If AUTOVACUUM is enabled then it is possible that another root page might be moved into the newly deleted root page in order to keep all root pages contiguous at the beginning of the database. The former value of the root page that moved - its value before the move occurred - is stored in register P2. If no page movement was required (because the table being dropped was already the last one in the database) then a zero is stored in register P2. If AUTOVACUUM is disabled then a zero is stored in register P2. This opcode throws an error if there are any active reader VMs when it is invoked. This is done to avoid the difficulty associated with updating existing cursors when a root page is moved in an AUTOVACUUM database. This error is thrown even if the database is not an AUTOVACUUM db in order to avoid introducing an incompatibility between autovacuum and non-autovacuum modes. See also: Clear" },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Divide", description: "Divide the value in register P1 by the value in register P2 and store the result in register P3 (P3=P2/P1). If the value in register P1 is zero, then the result is NULL. If either input is NULL, the result is NULL." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "DropIndex", description: "Remove the internal (in-memory) data structures that describe the index named P4 in database P1. This is called after an index is dropped from disk (using the Destroy opcode) in order to keep the internal representation of the schema consistent with what is on disk." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "DropTable", description: "Remove the internal (in-memory) data structures that describe the table named P4 in database P1. This is called after a table is dropped from disk (using the Destroy opcode) in order to keep the internal representation of the schema consistent with what is on disk." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "DropTrigger", description: "Remove the internal (in-memory) data structures that describe the trigger named P4 in database P1. This is called after a trigger is dropped from disk (using the Destroy opcode) in order to keep the internal representation of the schema consistent with what is on disk." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "ElseEq", description: "This opcode must follow an Lt or Gt comparison operator. There can be zero or more OP_ReleaseReg opcodes intervening, but no other opcodes are allowed to occur between this instruction and the previous Lt or Gt. If the result of an Eq comparison on the same two operands as the prior Lt or Gt would have been true, then jump to P2. If the result of an Eq comparison on the two previous operands would have been false or NULL, then fall through." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "EndCoroutine", description: "The instruction at the address in register P1 is a Yield. Jump to the P2 parameter of that Yield. After the jump, the value register P1 is left with a value such that subsequent OP_Yields go back to the this same EndCoroutine instruction. See also: InitCoroutine" },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Eq", description: "Compare the values in register P1 and P3. If reg(P3)==reg(P1) then jump to address P2. The SQLITE_AFF_MASK portion of P5 must be an affinity character - SQLITE_AFF_TEXT, SQLITE_AFF_INTEGER, and so forth. An attempt is made to coerce both inputs according to this affinity before the comparison is made. If the SQLITE_AFF_MASK is 0x00, then numeric affinity is used. Note that the affinity conversions are stored back into the input registers P1 and P3. So this opcode can cause persistent changes to registers P1 and P3. Once any conversions have taken place, and neither value is NULL, the values are compared. If both values are blobs then memcmp() is used to determine the results of the comparison. If both values are text, then the appropriate collating function specified in P4 is used to do the comparison. If P4 is not specified then memcmp() is used to compare text string. If both values are numeric, then a numeric comparison is used. If the two values are of different types, then numbers are considered less than strings and strings are considered less than blobs. If SQLITE_NULLEQ is set in P5 then the result of comparison is always either true or false and is never NULL. If both operands are NULL then the result of comparison is true. If either operand is NULL then the result is false. If neither operand is NULL the result is the same as it would be if the SQLITE_NULLEQ flag were omitted from P5. This opcode saves the result of comparison for use by the new Jump opcode." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Expire", description: "Cause precompiled statements to expire. When an expired statement is executed using sqlite3_step() it will either automatically reprepare itself (if it was originally created using sqlite3_prepare_v2()) or it will fail with SQLITE_SCHEMA. If P1 is 0, then all SQL statements become expired. If P1 is non-zero, then only the currently executing statement is expired. If P2 is 0, then SQL statements are expired immediately. If P2 is 1, then running SQL statements are allowed to continue to run to completion. The P2==1 case occurs when a CREATE INDEX or similar schema change happens that might help the statement run faster but which does not affect the correctness of operation." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Filter", description: "Compute a hash on the key contained in the P4 registers starting with r[P3]. Check to see if that hash is found in the bloom filter hosted by register P1. If it is not present then maybe jump to P2. Otherwise fall through. False negatives are harmless. It is always safe to fall through, even if the value is in the bloom filter. A false negative causes more CPU cycles to be used, but it should still yield the correct answer. However, an incorrect answer may well arise from a false positive - if the jump is taken when it should fall through." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "FilterAdd", description: "Compute a hash on the P4 registers starting with r[P3] and add that hash to the bloom filter contained in r[P1]." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "FinishSeek", description: "If cursor P1 was previously moved via DeferredSeek, complete that seek operation now, without further delay. If the cursor seek has already occurred, this instruction is a no-op." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "FkCheck", description: "Halt with an SQLITE_CONSTRAINT error if there are any unresolved foreign key constraint violations. If there are no foreign key constraint violations, this is a no-op. FK constraint violations are also checked when the prepared statement exits. This opcode is used to raise foreign key constraint errors prior to returning results such as a row change count or the result of a RETURNING clause." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "FkCounter", description: "Increment a \"constraint counter\" by P2 (P2 may be negative or positive). If P1 is non-zero, the database constraint counter is incremented (deferred foreign key constraints). Otherwise, if P1 is zero, the statement counter is incremented (immediate foreign key constraints)." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "FkIfZero", description: "This opcode tests if a foreign key constraint-counter is currently zero. If so, jump to instruction P2. Otherwise, fall through to the next instruction. If P1 is non-zero, then the jump is taken if the database constraint-counter is zero (the one that counts deferred constraint violations). If P1 is zero, the jump is taken if the statement constraint-counter is zero (immediate foreign key constraint violations)." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Found", description: "If P4==0 then register P3 holds a blob constructed by MakeRecord. If P4>0 then register P3 is the first of P4 registers that form an unpacked record. Cursor P1 is on an index btree. If the record identified by P3 and P4 is a prefix of any entry in P1 then a jump is made to P2 and P1 is left pointing at the matching entry. This operation leaves the cursor in a state where it can be advanced in the forward direction. The Next instruction will work, but not the Prev instruction. See also: NotFound, NoConflict, NotExists. SeekGe" },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Function", description: "Invoke a user function (P4 is a pointer to an sqlite3_context object that contains a pointer to the function to be run) with arguments taken from register P2 and successors. The number of arguments is in the sqlite3_context object that P4 points to. The result of the function is stored in register P3. Register P3 must not be one of the function inputs. P1 is a 32-bit bitmask indicating whether or not each argument to the function was determined to be constant at compile time. If the first argument was constant then bit 0 of P1 is set. This is used to determine whether meta data associated with a user function argument using the sqlite3_set_auxdata() API may be safely retained until the next invocation of this opcode. See also: AggStep, AggFinal, PureFunc" },

    OpCodeDescription { name: "Goto", description: "An unconditional jump to address P2. The next instruction executed will be the one at index P2 from the beginning of the program. The P1 parameter is not actually used by this opcode. However, it is sometimes set to 1 instead of 0 as a hint to the command-line shell that this Goto is the bottom of a loop and that the lines from P2 down to the current line should be indented for EXPLAIN output." },

    OpCodeDescription { name: "Halt", description: "Exit immediately. All open cursors, etc are closed automatically. P1 is the result code returned by sqlite3_exec(), sqlite3_reset(), or sqlite3_finalize(). For a normal halt, this should be SQLITE_OK (0). For errors, it can be some other value. If P1!=0 then P2 will determine whether or not to rollback the current transaction. Do not rollback if P2==OE_Fail. Do the rollback if P2==OE_Rollback. If P2==OE_Abort, then back out all changes that have occurred during this execution of the VDBE, but do not rollback the transaction. If P4 is not null then it is an error message string.

    OpCodeDescription { name: "IdxDelete", description: "The content of P3 registers starting at register P2 form an unpacked index key. This opcode removes that entry from the index opened by cursor P1. If P5 is not zero, then raise an SQLITE_CORRUPT_INDEX error if no matching index entry is found. This happens when running an UPDATE or DELETE statement and the index entry to be updated or deleted is not found. For some uses of IdxDelete (example: the EXCEPT operator) it does not matter that no matching entry is found. For those cases, P5 is zero. Also, do not raise this (self-correcting and non-critical) error if in writable_schema mode." },

Data for the entry is nil. If P4 is not zero, then it is the number of values in the unpacked key of reg(P2). In that case, P3 is the index of the first register for the unpacked key. The availability of the unpacked key can sometimes be an optimization. If P5 has the OPFLAG_APPEND bit set, that is a hint to the b-tree layer that this insert is likely to be an append. If P5 has the OPFLAG_NCHANGE bit set, then the change counter is incremented by this instruction. If the OPFLAG_NCHANGE bit is clear, then the change counter is unchanged. If the OPFLAG_USESEEKRESULT flag of P5 is set, the implementation might run faster by avoiding an unnecessary seek on cursor P1. However, the OPFLAG_USESEEKRESULT flag must only be set if there have been no prior seeks on the cursor or if the most recent seek used a key equivalent to P2. This instruction only works for indices. The equivalent instruction for tables is Insert." },

We want to know if it is possible for a record P3:P4 to match some record in the index. If it is not possible, we can skip some work. So if seekHit is less than P4, attempt to find out if a match is possible by running NotFound. This opcode is used in IN clause processing for a multi-column key. If an IN clause is attached to an element of the key other than the left-most element, and if there are no matches on the most recent seek over the whole key, then it might be that one of the key element to the left is prohibiting a match, and hence there is \"no hope\" of any match regardless of how many IN clause elements are checked.

P1 is a 32-bit bitmask indicating whether or not each argument to the function was determined to be constant at compile time. If the first argument was constant then bit 0 of P1 is set. This is used to determine whether meta data associated with a user function argument using the sqlite3_set_auxdata() API may be safely retained until the next invocation of this opcode. This opcode works exactly like Function. The only difference is in its name. This opcode is used in places where the function must be purely non-deterministic. Some built-in date/time functions can be either deterministic of non-deterministic, depending on their arguments. When those function are used in a non-deterministic way, they will check to see if they were called using PureFunc instead of Function, and if they were, they throw an error.

This constraint is checked by assert() statements. This opcode uses the P1 through P4 operands of the subsequent SeekGE. In the text that follows, the operands of the subsequent SeekGE opcode are denoted as SeekOP.P1 through SeekOP.P4. Only the P1, P2 and P5 operands of this opcode are also used, and are called This.P1, This.P2 and This.P5. This opcode helps to optimize IN operators on a multi-column index where the IN operator is on the later terms of the index by avoiding unnecessary seeks on the btree, substituting steps to the next row of the b-tree instead. A correct answer is obtained if this opcode is omitted or is a no-op. The SeekGE.P3 and SeekGE.P4 operands identify an unpacked key which is the desired entry that we want the cursor SeekGE.P1 to be pointing to. Call this SeekGE.P3/P4 row the \"target\". If the SeekGE.P1 cursor is not currently pointing to a valid row, then this opcode is a no-op and control passes through into the SeekGE. If the SeekGE.P1 cursor is pointing to a valid row, then that row might be the target row, or it might be near and slightly before the target row, or it might be after the target row. If the cursor is currently before the target row, then this opcode attempts to position the cursor on or after the target row by invoking sqlite3BtreeStep() on the cursor between 1 and This.P1 times. The This.P5 parameter is a flag that indicates what to do if the cursor ends up pointing at a valid row that is past the target row. If This.P5 is false (0) then a jump is made to SeekGE.P2. If This.P5 is true (non-zero) then a jump is made to This.P2. The P5==0 case occurs when there are no inequality constraints to the right of the IN constraint. The jump to SeekGE.P2 ends the loop. The P5!=0 case occurs when there are inequality constraints to the right of the IN operator. In that case, the This.P2 will point either directly to or to setup code prior to the IdxGT or IdxGE opcode that checks for loop terminate. Possible outcomes from this opcode:
    If the cursor is initially not pointed to any valid row, description:  then fall through into the subsequent SeekGE opcode.

This opcode invokes the xFilter method on the virtual table specified by P1. The integer query plan parameter to xFilter is stored in register P3. Register P3+1 stores the argc parameter to be passed to the xFilter method. Registers P3+2..P3+1+argc are the argc additional parameters which are passed to xFilter as argv. Register P3+2 becomes argv[0] when passed to xFilter. A jump is made to P2 if the result set after filtering would be empty." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "VInitIn", description: "Set register P2 to be a pointer to a ValueList object for cursor P1 with cache register P3 and output register P3+1. This ValueList object can be used as the first argument to sqlite3_vtab_in_first() and sqlite3_vtab_in_next() to extract all of the values stored in the P1 cursor. Register P3 is used to hold the values returned by sqlite3_vtab_in_first() and sqlite3_vtab_in_next()." },

    OpCodeDescription { name: "VOpen", description: "P4 is a pointer to a virtual table object, an sqlite3_vtab structure. P1 is a cursor number. This opcode opens a cursor to the virtual table and stores that cursor in P1." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "VRename", description: "P4 is a pointer to a virtual table object, an sqlite3_vtab structure. This opcode invokes the corresponding xRename method. The value in register P1 is passed as the zName argument to the xRename method." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "VUpdate", description: "P4 is a pointer to a virtual table object, an sqlite3_vtab structure. This opcode invokes the corresponding xUpdate method. P2 values are contiguous memory cells starting at P3 to pass to the xUpdate invocation. The value in register (P3+P2-1) corresponds to the p2th element of the argv array passed to xUpdate. The xUpdate method will do a DELETE or an INSERT or both. The argv[0] element (which corresponds to memory cell P3) is the rowid of a row to delete. If argv[0] is NULL then no deletion occurs. The argv[1] element is the rowid of the new row. This can be NULL to have the virtual table select the new rowid for itself. The subsequent elements in the array are the values of columns in the new row. If P2==1 then no insert is performed. argv[0] is the rowid of a row to delete. P1 is a boolean flag. If it is set to true and the xUpdate call is successful, then the value returned by sqlite3_last_insert_rowid() is set to the value of the rowid for the row just inserted. P5 is the error actions (OE_Replace, OE_Fail, OE_Ignore, etc) to apply in the case of a constraint failure on an insert or update." },
    OpCodeDescription { name: "Yield", description: "Swap the program counter with the value in register P1. This has the effect of yielding to a coroutine. If the coroutine that is launched by this instruction ends with Yield or Return then continue to the next instruction. But if the coroutine launched by this instruction ends with EndCoroutine, then jump to P2 rather than continuing with the next instruction. See also: InitCoroutine" },
