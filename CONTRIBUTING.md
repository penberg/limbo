# Contributing to Limbo

We'd love to have you contribute to Limbo!

This document is a quick helper to get you going.

## Finding things to work on

The issue tracker has issues tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/penberg/limbo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22),
which are considered to be things to work on to get going. If you're interested in working on one of them, comment on the issue tracker, and we're happy to help you get going.

## Submitting your work

Fork the repository and open a pull request to submit your work. Please consider:

* Running `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to keep the code formatting in check.
* Running `make` to run the test suite.

As general guideline for pull requests, please:

* Don't mix fixes and cleanups in same pull request. They just increase the likelhood of merge conflicts. Cleanups are welcome, but just keep them separate.
* Prefer `git rebase main` over `git merge main` on your branches to keep git logs clean.

## Debugging query execution

Limbo aims towards SQLite compatibility. If you find a query that has different behavior than SQLite, the first step is to check what the generated bytecode looks like.

To do that, first run the `EXPLAIN` command in `sqlite3` shell:

```
sqlite> EXPLAIN SELECT first_name FROM users;
addr  opcode         p1    p2    p3    p4             p5  comment
----  -------------  ----  ----  ----  -------------  --  -------------
0     Init           0     7     0                    0   Start at 7
1     OpenRead       0     2     0     2              0   root=2 iDb=0; users
2     Rewind         0     6     0                    0
3       Column         0     1     1                    0   r[1]= cursor 0 column 1
4       ResultRow      1     1     0                    0   output=r[1]
5     Next           0     3     0                    1
6     Halt           0     0     0                    0
7     Transaction    0     0     1     0              1   usesStmtJournal=0
8     Goto           0     1     0                    0
```

and then run the same command in Limbo's shell.

If the bytecode is different, that's the bug -- work towards fixing code generation.
If the bytecode is the same, but query results are different, then the bug is somewhere in the virtual machine interpreter or storage layer.

## Compatibility tests

The `testing/test.all` is a starting point for adding functional tests using a similar syntax to SQLite.
The purpose of these tests is to verify behavior matches with SQLite and Limbo.

To run the test suite with Limbo, simply run:

```
make test
```

To run the test suite with SQLite, type:

```
SQLITE_EXEC=sqlite3 make test
```

When working on a new feature, please consider adding a test case for it.

## Deterministic simulation tests

The `simulator` directory contains a deterministic simulator for testing.
What this means is that the behavior of a test run is deterministic based on the seed value.
If the simulator catches a bug, you can always reproduce the exact same sequence of events by passing the same seed.
The simulator also performs fault injection to discover interesting bugs.

## Building perf/latency

In order to build the perf/latency which simulates the multitenancy usage of Limbo, you will need to use the nightly compiler of Rust because it uses experimental features.

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
cd perf/latency/limbo
cargo +nightly build
```
